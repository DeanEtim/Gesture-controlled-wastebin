# Gesture-Controlled Waste Bin

This project started as a beginner embedded systems project for an academic summit
and was later upgraded with computer vision using OpenCV.

## Features
- Hands-free waste bin operation
- ESP32-based control system
- Hand gesture recognition using OpenCV

## Technologies Used
- ESP32 / Arduino
- Python
- OpenCV
- Embedded Systems

## How It Works
The ESP32 controls the bin mechanism while a computer vision system detects hand gestures
and sends commands to the controller.

## Getting Started
1. Upload the ESP32 firmware from the `ESP32_code` folder
2. Run the Python OpenCV script from the `computer_vision` folder
3. Perform hand gestures in front of the camera

## Demo
Images and vidoes are available in the `Demo` folder
